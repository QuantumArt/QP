When you update ckeditor you should follow next steps:
    1. Download new full version folder from official site
    2. Copy `./skins/moonocolor/` to new version folder
    3. Copy `./plugins/codemirror/` to new version folder
    4. Copy `./config.js` to new version folder (not required, but useful for demonstration)
    5. Replace old folder with new folder
    6. ...
    7. Profit ^_^
